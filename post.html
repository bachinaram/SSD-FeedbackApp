          Motorcycle Trip From Hyderabad to Rajasthan, PART 1 - JAIPUR
        </h1>

        <p class="todaycontent">
          The contemporary resolutions will make on the first day of every new
          year and I'm not an exception. In the last year, I pledge myself to
          read at least twelve books to reach a certain state of mind. But I
          ended up traveling more, and more. I didn't realize till the day I
          begin my journey to 4600 KM, a round-trip from Hyderabad to Rajasthan.
          If I call up the year 2018 I have traveled to Kanyakumari, Hampi,
          Gandikota, Rajasthan, and many places nearby Hyderabad. I am well
          aware that the several places I have been and drove are certainly not
          a major league but I sure got some state of mind.<br /><br />
          For Rajasthan trip, we predetermined to cover Jaipur, Ajmer, Pushkar,
          Jodhpur, and Jaisalmer. Managing time for travel and work is so
          difficult and an idea of covering whole state requires lot of days.
          It's not easy to get ten vacation leaves unless it is a holiday
          season. Traveling to the northern part of India during winter is also
          not so easy as planned, especially on motorcycle. We beaten all odds
          and jacket'd up for ride.<br /><br />
          We started off our trip on Friday at 3:00 PM from Hyderabad to Nagpur
          and reached our destination by 10:00 PM. Temperature has been
          gradually decreasing with time. By the time we reach Nagpur we all are
          tied and felt cold to drive any further. Unlike, Kanyakumari trip
          during the peak summer we have pre-booked hotel for night stay.<br /><br />
          On our first full ride day, we started the journey a few hours late
          than planned due to extreme fog in Nagpur. As per schedule, we aimed
          to drive a thousand kilometers to reach Jaipur even if it is late. We
          ended up driving just 700 KMs due to small hitches like a petrol
          overflow to one of the bike and extreme cold of 15 degrees Celsius
          during the evening, potholes, bumpy roads and famous cow crossing in
          national highways. We called it a day at Gwalior and nearly 350 KMs
          away from our first Rajasthan destination - JAIPUR.<br /><br />
          On the second day, woke up early and started off to ride 350 KMS, on
          seeing the welcome sign "Rajasthan State Welcome You" we can't wait to
          see Jaipur in high spirits. Reached our first destination Jaipur in
          the afternoon and till here drove the total of 1600 KMs. Dropped off
          the luggage in hotel swiftly freshen up for sight-seeing.<br /><br />
          On the Day1, we halted site seeing by visiting Jal Mahal and Amer
          Palace. All of us want to taste the famous local cuisine, and what
          another way to find out rather than searching for a qualified rating
          from online just by talking to locals. We spoke to random people to
          find the best place for dinner and most of them recommended "Shree
          Khandelwal Pavitra Bhojanalaya". I'm not going to write a review or
          explain how the food tastes but must say, it hits the taste buds and I
          would recommend everyone to visit this place with family when you are
          in Jaipur. Many of the visitants may not like the ambiance but they
          serve fast and responds well.<br /><br />

        <h2>Jaipur City - Day2</h2>
        One thing we realized on Day1 about Jaipur city has its traffic. I mean
        Jaipur does not have huge traffic as in other metropolitan cities like
        Bangalore, Mumbai, and Delhi but what it really has people with lack of
        traffic sense. Locals are polite and respectful to visitors but when
        they drive they have an urgency to jump the signal and ignore the
        traffic rules. So we decided to give break to our bikes and try an
        electric rickshaw unique transport vehicle can only found in Jaipur.<br /><br />

        <h2>HAWA MAHAL</h2>
        The palace of the breeze constructed date back in 1799 for royal women
        to observe festivals on streets and everyday common man's life through
        this palace small windows. An exquisite architecture calmly resides on a
        side of the busy road in Jaipur. Out of all tourist places, Hawa Mahal
        has its own p rominence and holds hefty viewership in social media -
        Selfie with Hawa Mahal. <br /><br />
