          Motorcycle Trip From Hyderabad to Rajasthan, PART 1 - JAIPUR
        </h1>
        <span class="today">Oct 7, 2020 | RAM</span>
        <p class="todaycontent">
          The contemporary resolutions will make on the first day of every new
          year and I'm not an exception. In the last year, I pledge myself to
          read at least twelve books to reach a certain state of mind. But I
          ended up traveling more, and more. I didn't realize till the day I
          begin my journey to 4600 KM, a round-trip from Hyderabad to Rajasthan.
          If I call up the year 2018 I have traveled to Kanyakumari, Hampi,
          Gandikota, Rajasthan, and many places nearby Hyderabad. I am well
          aware that the several places I have been and drove are certainly not
          a major league but I sure got some state of mind. <br /><br />
          For Rajasthan trip, we predetermined to cover Jaipur, Ajmer, Pushkar,
          Jodhpur, and Jaisalmer. Managing time for travel and work is so
          difficult and an idea of covering whole state requires lot of days.
          It's not easy to get ten vacation leaves unless it is a holiday
          season. Traveling to the northern part of India during winter is also
          not so easy as planned, especially on motorcycle. We beaten all odds
          and jacket'd up for ride. <br /><br />We started off our trip on
          Friday at 3:00 PM from Hyderabad to Nagpur and reached our destination
          by 10:00 PM. Temperature has been gradually decreasing with time. By
          the time we reach Nagpur we all are tied and felt cold to drive any
          further. Unlike, Kanyakumari trip during the peak summer we have
          pre-booked hotel for night stay.
